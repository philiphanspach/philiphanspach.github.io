The German startup scene is diverse and thriving but suffering from one critical flaw: access to credit. Traditional banks are often reluctant to extend credit and public investment funds have bureaucratic and slow processes. 

I help startups raising critical credit lines through private investment, allowing targeted scaling when and how you need it.

For private investors this is an exciting opportunity to make returns that typically far exceed traditional mutual funds, treasury bills and bonds. Introductions are on a commission-basis that ensures arms-length business with the highest degree of independence.

Don't miss your chance to invest in German startups.

Industries covered (excerpt): industrial software, AI applications (fault detection; medical screening; automated construction, design and architectural services), B2B engineering services, DTC manufacturing platforms.
